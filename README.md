## Overview

Search any city for real-time weather and a 5-day forecast. Click one button, and a CrewAI agent reads the live data, writes a natural-language summary, and emails it to you using its own email tool — no manual copy-pasting, the agent decides and acts on its own.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python, Flask, Jinja2
- **API:** OpenWeatherMap (live weather + forecast)
- **AI/LLM:** CrewAI (agent orchestration) + OpenAI (reasoning) + a custom email tool built on `smtplib`
- **Frontend:** HTML, custom CSS, vanilla JavaScript — no frameworks
- **Config:** python-dotenv for API keys

## Features

- 🌍 Live weather (temp, humidity, wind, pressure, visibility)
- 📅 5-day forecast
- 🤖 AI agent that writes and emails a weather summary autonomously
- 🎨 Custom instrument-panel-style UI
- ⚡ Error handling for bad input, city-not-found, and network failures

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-agent.git
cd weather-agent
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file:
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
EMAIL_ADDRESS=your_gmail_address@gmail.com
EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your_16_character_app_password
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=any_random_string

Run it:
```bash
python app.py
```

## How It Works

1. Search a city → Flask fetches live weather + forecast from OpenWeatherMap
2. Click "Email Me This Summary" → weather data is handed to a CrewAI agent
3. The agent (powered by an OpenAI LLM) writes a short summary and autonomously calls its email tool to send it

## Roadmap

- [ ] WhatsApp delivery via Twilio
- [ ] Persistent search history (SQLite)
- [ ] "Use my location" via geolocation
- [ ] Deploy live (Render / PythonAnywhere)
